# WTW-Data-Cleaning
One of our compensation survey vendors give us data on a challenging format. It comes with a zip file full of folders with many unnecessary Excel files and some necessary files. This tool unzips everything, sorts what is important versus whatâ€™s not, consolidates all the files, rearranges columns, extracts information from other tabs, and puts together a bigger data frame with the information we need to upload into our HR Information System platform. Coded in Python.

This whole process used to take hours each time we got new data. With this script, it now only takes about 2 minutes.
